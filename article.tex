The most damaging cyberattack committed against the United States federal government by a foreign agent was remarkably subtle. Starting sometime in 2014, a small probe embedded itself deep within the network of the US Office of Personnel Management (OPM), an office of about 5,000 employees tasked with overseeing background checks, payroll, and other human resources concerns for the federal government. At regular intervals, the probe would send updates to opmsecurity.org, a domain registered to look like an official website, but not actually affiliated with the US government or the OPM security team. Unobtrusive and observant, the probe functioned in all respects like a digital spy.

By the time the breach was discovered in April 2015, the probe had accessed crucial government databases and transmitted the stolen information back to its country of origin---including a trove of applications for federal security clearance. These applications exposed not just the personal data of the applicants themselves but also the detailed information they had supplied about their family and friends, including social security numbers, job applications, and home addresses. Federal authorities determined that the hack ultimately affected 22.1 million people in total, including personnel at the highest levels of government.\footcite{nakashima_hacks_2015} When OPM announced the full extent of the damage, it caused an uproar. The American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal workers union, filed a class-action lawsuit against OPM, seeking damages under the Privacy Act.\footcite{chalfant_court_2017} Senator Mark Warner (D-Va.) of the Senate Intelligence Committee called for OPM Director Katherine Archuleta's resignation. Because the information might be used for identity theft, the US government offered all affected employees free credit and identity monitoring services for three years.

Not only was the OPM hack a public relations disaster, it had significant national security implications as well. US officials feared that the stolen records could compromise intelligence efforts by exposing undercover CIA officers working in embassies around the world, whose names would be suspiciously absent from the OPM records. The information could also be used to identify American officials who might be susceptible to pressure, or worse, recruitment. FBI Director James Comey personally took questions about the incident. ``If you have my [application for security clearance],'' Comey said, ``you know every place I've lived since I was 18, contact people at those addresses, neighbors at those addresses, all of my family, every place I've traveled outside the United States. Just imagine if you were a foreign intelligence service and you had that data.''\footcite{nakashima_hacks_2015} With evidence that a foreign intelligence service had successfully obtained exactly that, one might expect that the United States would respond with a series of diplomatic measures intended to signal that highly invasive acts of espionage would not be tolerated from its international adversaries.

Instead, the opposite happened. US officials would only confirm that they believed a \enquote{foreign entity or government} had been behind the attack, even though it was widely known that they suspected the involvement of the Chinese government.\footcite{spetalnick_china_2015} Internal investigators quickly determined that OPM had been compromised by an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT), a formally organized and typically state-sponsored group of hackers that engage in long-term, targeted penetration operations. In this case, the APT made identification easy by leaving their calling-card: the trojan opmsecurity.org domain was registered in the name of \enquote{Steve Rogers,} the Marvel comics character better known as Captain America. This digital taunt, along with email and IP addresses that verified the country of origin was not a false flag, all but guaranteed that the attack had come from an APT sponsored by the Chinese government, likely the Chinese military's cyber-espionage division.\footcite{koerner_inside_2016} Sitting on conclusive digital forensics, the Obama administration nonetheless refused to name China as the culprit.\footnote{National Security Advisor John Bolton was the first American official to formally acknowledge that the Chinese were behind the OPM hack, three years later, in September 2018. See \cite{sanger_trump_2018}}

The US government's tepid response to the OPM hack illustrates a universally understood but rarely acknowledged fact about the relationship between cybersecurity and espionage: when a cyber operation appears to fall within the bounds of a traditional intelligence operation, it will merit the same diplomatic consequences that a traditional intelligence operation would have. Typically those consequences are minimal, rarely amounting to more than a pat denunciation of the activity and the necessary countermeasures to end it. Most importantly, those consequences never rise to the level where they impose additional costs on the state that attempted the espionage in the first place; in the rare cases when costs \emph{are} imposed for a traditional espionage operation, they are not costs that would discourage the aggressor from attempting such an operation again.

At first glance this observation might seem almost tautological in its simplicity. Of course cyber-espionage is treated like traditional espionage, one could argue---they're both espionage. That formulation begs the question;  it doesn't explain how states determine what constitutes \enquote{traditional} espionage, what purpose that distinction servers, or whether it is prudent to continue making it.

Despite the magnitude of the OPM hack, American officials had a hard time seeing it as anything other than a well-executed bit of espionage. A senior White House official told the Congressional Research Service that \enquote{there is a vast distinction between intelligence-gathering activities that all countries do and [other forms of malicious cyber-activity].} For activities that fall under the umbrella of intelligence-gathering, counterintelligence, not prosecutions, are deemed to be the appropriate response.\footcite[In the context of the quote, the White House official is distinguishing between traditional espionage and economic espionage, the latter of which is the state-sponsored theft of trade secrets from foreign private companies in order to gain a competitive advantage in international markets.]{finklea_cyber_2015} Director of the CIA John Brennan described foreign spying on domestic political institutions as \enquote{fair game.}\footcite{sanger_u.s._2016} And while speaking at an intelligence conference, James Clapper, Director of National Intelligence, committed a classic Kinsley gaffe—saying what every official knows to be true but would never admit out loud: \enquote{You have to kind of salute the Chinese for what they did. If we had the opportunity to do that, I don’t think we’d hesitate for a minute.}\footcite{pepitone_clapper_2015}


% In recent years, cyberattacks perpetrated by state-sponsored foreign agents have received ever-increasing levels of public scrutiny---which makes the government's response to the OPM hack especially puzzling. Why did an incident of this magnitude not merit an official response?

% This article seeks to explain why espionage efforts are not more actively discouraged by nations, even as the results of intelligence operations can oftentimes have a devastating effect on the targeted nation's security.

% Russian interference in the 2016 US Presidential election prompted the expulsion of 37 diplomats and series of follow-on sanctions


% first it will lay out how espionage is considered an occupational hazard in the business of running a nation-state, one that is counteracted but never discourages.

% next I will discuss the theoretical justifications for why this might be the case. security seeking states and types of greedy states derive a reational benefit from allowing espionage to continue.

% finally I will look at historical moments in which new technologies were deployed for espionage-like purporses, and demonstrate how the norms governing the use of these technologies always evolved to permit espionage.
